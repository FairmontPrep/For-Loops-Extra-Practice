![pattern2-stars](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/831d5de8-42bb-4f8d-b95f-1f8adf9268da)
![pattern3-stars](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51e7c086-51f6-49c5-820f-d4dc8a631d68)

         
For Part 2 students will use WHILE loops to draw the same patterns from before.
Use concatenation to build your lines of stars one by one
Use Print statements to print out your stars.
Use if statements to create the changes in your shapes
Create a main.java file and begin coding in your main method.
